Tool Inventory v2
Authors: Brian Price and Micheal Ferguson

This project is to keep an accurate inventory of high value items in a shop environment.

This version allows the user to enter information into the text boxes and then convert them into array objects.

Solution Benefits:
Version 2 of this project has refactored the code to streamline and use function constructors for the data. Seeing the original project did not have functional table data viewable, getting a fully functional program is the first priority.  This has be implemented by creating objects or arrays for each item and putting them into a mock database.  In addition, JavaScript will be used to store the Strings placed into the Description and convert the value into an integer to calculate the running total.

Solution Limitations and Possible Extensions:
This solution does not have any persistent storage built into it in its current state.  Upon refreshing the webpage, all data will be lost.  In addition, this system is built based off of purchase price instead of estimated value.  Depreciation of tools can be a complicated value that fluctuates depending on the market.  If desired, estimated value could be used instead of purchase price, but purchase price works better for my use.
